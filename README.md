Title: Machine Learning-Driven Approach to Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
Introduction:
The advancement of automated systems has provided a means to support educators in
grading written material. The proposed project aims to create a Machine Learning (ML)
model for Automated Essay Scoring that can accurately assess written essays,
reducing subjective bias and improving the efficiency of the grading process.
Objectives:
● Develop a model capable of scoring essays based on a range of criteria including
grammar, relevance, and coherence.
● Benchmark the model against human scoring to ensure reliability.
● Investigate the impact of different feature extraction methods on the accuracy of
the scoring model.
Methodology:
● Dataset: Use the ASAP-AES dataset containing essays with human expert
scores.
● Feature Extraction: Apply NLP techniques, such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and
syntactic parsing, to convert text into a feature set.
● Model Selection: Experiment with various ML algorithms including Ridge
Regression, SVM, and Ensemble Methods.
● Evaluation: Utilize metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to
validate the model's performance.
Expected Results:
The project is anticipated to deliver an AES system that closely correlates with human
scoring. Insights into the most predictive features and effective ML models for
automated scoring will be highlighted, offering a potential tool for educational
institutions.
